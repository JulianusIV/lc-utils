# lcutils

A general utility mod for the Lathland Community Minecraft Server

## Features

- Changed Wandering Trader offers (ported [HyperPigeon's Better-Wandering-Trader mod](https://github.com/HyperPigeon/Better-Wandering-Trader/tree/master) to 1.20.1, stripped clientside functionality and updated codestyle)
- Player gets sent death coordinates to find their stuff more easily

## ToDo

- Home commmand system
 - `/sethome` command
 - `/home` command to teleport home, usable only every few minutes
 - `/back` command to teleport back to where you just came from (only works within some timeframe after `/home` was executed)
